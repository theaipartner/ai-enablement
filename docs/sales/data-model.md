# Sales — Data Model

The entities, the funnel, and the table manifest. For the *matching rules* that turn
raw rows into these concepts, see [`logic.md`](./logic.md).

## The lead definition — the "unique leads list"

This is the single definition the whole product runs off. A **unique lead** is a
person who:

1. is **non-revival** — the `REVIVAL_CF` custom field is empty (revival leads are a
   separate campaign, see below) — and not soft-hidden (`close_leads.excluded_at IS NULL`);
2. has a **Typeform `SFedWelr` match** by email/phone — the high-ticket opt-in gate;
3. **first opted in on or after 2026-05-24** — `close_leads.date_first_opted_in >= '2026-05-24'`.

**Returning leads** (first opted in *before* May 24, re-opted after) are **excluded
everywhere** in the funnel and roster — they made the data messy (Drake's call). They
still render a per-lead page, but it shows "No opt-in cycle yet".

### `lead_cycles` IS the unique leads list

The tagger (`lib/db/lead-tags.ts`) writes one row per opt-in cycle to `lead_cycles`,
and its universe is exactly the unique-leads predicate above. There is **no
`close_fallback`** — no Typeform match means no cycle. A full `--apply` retag **wipes
and rebuilds** `lead_cycles`. `lead_cycles` is the aggregation substrate for the
funnel, roster, per-lead page, DC funnel, and Cash.

### Two counts — keep them distinct

- **Lead list** (roster / speed-to-lead / FMR) = **unique people** (~295).
- **Funnel** = **opt-in events** = Typeform-sourced `lead_cycles` rows whose `opt_in_at`
  is in window (~300–318). One person opting in twice in-window counts twice.

`getSpeedToLeadCohort` membership = `close_leads` (in-window `date_first_opted_in`,
non-revival, `excluded_at IS NULL`) **∩** a `lead_cycles` row with `source='typeform'`
in window. Every cohort row is `optInType:'new'` — the old Close-status qualification
and the re-opt-in branch are gone; the all/unique toggle and the Opt-in badge column
were removed.

---

## The funnel

A **cumulative, monotonic** ladder. Each box counts each lead **once**; reaching a
stage means "got at least this far":

```
opt-ins → connected → booked → confirmed → showed → closed
```

- **`confirmed` exists only on Direct (and Total).** Setter and Reactivation skip it.
- The **closed** node is split `(N HT / N DC)`.
- `books ≥ connected ≥ confirms ≥ shows ≥ closes` — enforced as an integrity guard.
  **Exception:** in the **Total** funnel, Books *can* exceed Connected, because a pure
  self-booked direct booking is not a "connection" (intended).

`reachedStage(row, type, stage)` in `lib/db/leads-funnel.ts` is the single source of
truth — the **funnel box count** and the **roster filter** both call it, so a bar's
number always equals the roster it links to.

### Lead types — read from the tag, not the Close column

Type comes from the tagger (`lead_cycles`), **not** `close_leads.reactivated_at`:

- **Direct** = `tagBecameDirect` — the lead self-booked a strategy-call link.
- **Setter** = not direct.
- **Reactivation** = `tagReactivatedAt` — a lead that lost / went cold on its spot.

**Direct and Setter partition the cohort. Reactivation cross-cuts both** (a Setter
lead that goes cold and is re-booked is Setter *and* Reactivation). This reverses the
old "reactivation ⊂ direct" framing — that invariant is gone. When the tag and the
legacy `reactivated_at` column disagree, **the tag wins** (the column is a legacy
backfill + the fallback for leads with no `lead_cycles` row only).

## High Ticket vs Digital College

- **High Ticket (HT)** — the AI Partner program. The default funnel is HT-only.
- **Digital College (DC)** — the low-ticket offer (Base44 + Wix, sold Monthly/Yearly),
  often a downsell.

**Closer identity routes everything** (migration 0076): `DC_CLOSER_NAMES = ("robby",)`
(Adam later) → DC funnel; everyone else (Aman = HT closer) → HT. Routing is read from
the **main closer EOC form** (`airtable_full_closer_report`), not the dedicated DC form.

- **DC showed** = a DC-closer form is *present* (Robby over-marks "Digital College
  Closed", so presence = showed; the outcome value is ignored).
- **DC closed** = a real plan is selected (`dc_plans`), origin `dc_closer`.
- **Downsells** (HT closer selling DC): `dc_close_origin = downsell_ht_meeting` (HT EOC
  with a DC plan) or `downsell_confirmation` (Closer Triage `call_status='Downsold'`).
  A downsell sets `dc_closed_at` but not `dc_booked_at`/`dc_showed_at`, stays
  HT-showed-not-HT-closed, and is credited to the **HT** closer.
- The tagger's `closed_at` / `close_type` are **HT-only**. **Robby's EOC forms are
  fully excluded from HT show/close** (not just his closes).
- `lead_cycles` DC columns (0076): `digital_college_at`, `dc_booked_at`, `dc_showed_at`,
  `dc_close_origin` (`dc_closed_at` pre-existed).

## Revival (separate campaign — not part of the main funnel)

The **DC Revival** re-engagement campaign. Leads carry `REVIVAL_CF`
(`cf_QivXkWBvr34UIDkUBKXNCQo6woarc62wEbIacWWbN7P`, "DC Revival Lead") — ~2,115 today.
They have no Typeform cycle, so they drop out of the cohort, the tagger, and every main
funnel. The **`/funnel/revival`** sub-page is the **only** surface that counts them, and
it reads **raw signals, no tagger**. Per-lead anchor = later of (`date_created`,
`2026-05-24 00:00 ET`); a signal counts only if its timestamp ≥ anchor.

Don't confuse **Revival** (this campaign) with **Reactivation** (a unique lead that lost
its strategy-call spot — a `lead_cycles` flag, part of the main funnel).

---

## Cash Collected / ROAS

A Cash block on the Funnel page, separate from the DC funnel. Two rows, each split
HT / DC / total:

- **Upfront** = `amount_paid_today`.
- **Contract** = `contract_amount_to_send` (closers leave `total_contract_amount`
  empty — key off `contract_amount_to_send`).
- **ROAS** = cash ÷ **Closer-Funnel adspend** (`Closer Funnel`-token campaigns in
  `cortana_campaign_daily`, per-day fallback to `meta_ad_daily` account total before
  2026-05-26).
- DC is priced at a flat **$300 per plan unit** (`DC_PLAN_PRICE_USD`), same upfront and
  contract.

## Lead → ad attribution (verified 2026-06-11)

Every unique lead carries its source ad **natively from Close** — no heuristic
matching needed. On the unique-lead cohort, `close_leads.ad_id` / `ad_name` /
`campaign_id` / `adset_id` / `utm_campaign` are **~99% populated** (356/359), and
`ad_id` joins to `cortana_ad_daily.platform_entity_id` (the Meta ad id) with **100%
coverage** — every lead's `ad_id` exists in Cortana. So the funnel is sliceable down to
the individual ad/creative, with spend + ROAS per ad.

- **Join path:** `lead_cycles.close_id` → `close_leads.ad_id` →
  `cortana_ad_daily.platform_entity_id`.
- The ~1–2% with no `ad_id` are organic/direct. `utm_source` is empty (0%) — use
  `ad_name` / `campaign_id` instead.
- ⚠️ Don't confuse with the **~20%** figure in `logic.md` — that's a *different* join
  (Calendly bookings ↔ leads via `utm_term`), not lead→ad. Lead→ad is ~99%.

### Shared (sales reads, but fulfillment also uses)

| Table | Note |
|-------|------|
| `calls` | Fathom call records — sales uses `call_category='client'` rows for meeting-duration metrics; CSM uses it too |
| `team_members` | rep identities + access tiers — gates the dashboard, used elsewhere |
| `call_classification_history` | classification log for `calls` rows |
| `webhook_deliveries` | shared webhook-delivery audit log (~121k rows; all ingestion endpoints) |
| `oauth_tokens` | shared OAuth token store (Google, etc.) |

### Fulfillment / CSM / agent infra — **not sales**

`clients`, `client_health_scores`, `client_journey_stage_history`, `client_meetings`,
`client_standing_history`, `client_status_history`, `client_team_assignments`,
`client_upsells`, `calendar_events`, `call_action_items`, `call_participants`,
`nps_submissions`, `agent_feedback`, `agent_runs`, `alerts`, `escalations`,
`pending_digest_items`, `pending_ella_responses`, `slack_channels`, `slack_messages`,
`document_chunks`, `documents`, `director_tasks`,
`monthly_subscriptions`, `cost_extras`.
