# Sales — Data Model

The entities, the funnel, and the table manifest. For the *matching rules* that turn
raw rows into these concepts, see [`logic.md`](./logic.md).

## The lead definition — the "unique leads list"

This is the single definition the whole product runs off. A **unique lead** is a
person who:

1. is **non-revival** — the `REVIVAL_CF` custom field is empty (revival leads are a
   separate campaign, see below) — and not soft-hidden (`close_leads.excluded_at IS NULL`);
2. has a **high-ticket Typeform match** by email/phone — the opt-in gate. The accepted
   forms (`OPT_IN_FORMS` in `shared/lead_tagging.py`, mirrored in `funnel-assets.ts`
   `HIGH_TICKET_TYPEFORM_FORM_IDS`) are **`SFedWelr`** (original LP) and **`Os4c0q6V`**
   (the `/training` LP, live 2026-06-20). Both share the same investment/qualification
   field ref (`5138f17b`). A lead matching *either* form qualifies; submissions across
   forms merge into one per-person cycle history (deduped per minute);
3. **first opted in on or after 2026-05-24** — `close_leads.date_first_opted_in >= '2026-05-24'`.

**Returning leads** (first opted in *before* May 24, re-opted after) are **excluded
everywhere** in the funnel and roster — they made the data noisy and are excluded by
design. They still render a per-lead page, but it shows "No opt-in cycle yet".

### `lead_cycles` IS the unique leads list

The tagger (`shared/lead_tagging.py`) writes one row per opt-in cycle to `lead_cycles`,
and its universe is exactly the unique-leads predicate above. There is **no
`close_fallback`** — no high-ticket Typeform match (any `OPT_IN_FORMS`) means no cycle. A full `--apply` retag **wipes
and rebuilds** `lead_cycles`. `lead_cycles` is the aggregation substrate for the
funnel, roster, per-lead page, DC funnel, and Cash.

### Two counts — keep them distinct

- **Lead list** (roster / speed-to-lead / FMR) = **unique people** (~295).
- **Funnel** = **opt-in events** = Typeform-sourced `lead_cycles` rows whose `opt_in_at`
  is in window (~300–318). One person opting in twice in-window counts twice.

`getSpeedToLeadCohort` membership = `close_leads` (in-window `date_first_opted_in`,
non-revival, `excluded_at IS NULL`) **∩** a `lead_cycles` row with `source='typeform'`
in window. Every cohort row is `optInType:'new'` — the old Close-status qualification
and the re-opt-in branch are gone; the all/unique toggle and the Opt-in badge column
were removed.

---

## The funnel

A **cumulative, monotonic** ladder. Each box counts each lead **once**; reaching a
stage means "got at least this far":

```
opt-ins → connected → booked → confirmed → showed → closed
```

- **`confirmed` exists only on Direct (and Total).** Setter and Reactivation skip it.
- **The Total box does not *display* a Books node** (removed 2026-06-17 — Confirms is the
  meaningful node there). `books` is still computed and still drives the integrity guard +
  the Direct / Setter / Reactivation boxes; it's only hidden from the Total box's bars.
- The **closed** node is split `(N HT / N DC)`.
- Within each box a later stage can't exceed an earlier one — enforced as an integrity
  guard (`validateFunnel`). **Direct & Total are books-first:** Books *can* exceed Connected
  — a self-booked direct lead (or any lead booked with no ≥90s call) is booked-but-not-connected;
  intended, and now common since connected = a ≥90s call only. **Setter &
  Reactivation expect Connected ≥ Books** and flag a violation otherwise (a setter booking
  should have a real conversation behind it).

`reachedStage(row, type, stage)` in `lib/db/leads-funnel.ts` is the single source of
truth — the **funnel box count** and the **roster filter** both call it, so a bar's
number always equals the roster it links to.

### Lead types — read from the tag, not the Close column

Type comes from the tagger (`lead_cycles`), **not** `close_leads.reactivated_at`:

- **Direct** = `tagBecameDirect` — the lead self-booked a strategy-call link.
- **Setter** = not direct.
- **Reactivation** = `tagReactivatedAt` — a lead that lost / went cold on its spot.

**Direct and Setter partition the cohort. Reactivation cross-cuts both** (a Setter
lead that goes cold and is re-booked is Setter *and* Reactivation). This reverses the
old "reactivation ⊂ direct" framing — that invariant is gone. When the tag and the
legacy `reactivated_at` column disagree, **the tag wins** (the column is a legacy
backfill + the fallback for leads with no `lead_cycles` row only).

The Reactivation box's **dials bracket** counts post-reactivation outbound dials
lower-bounded on the tagger's `reactive_at` too (migration 0087 / `sales_funnel_counts`).
It previously keyed off `close_leads.reactivated_at`, which the 0063–0065 backfill set
for only ~20 leads while the tagger marks ~316 — so the bracket read ~0 next to non-zero
books/shows until the bound moved onto the tag.

**Two reactivation kinds dial differently** (`lead_cycles.reactive_source`):
- **`cold`** — `reactive_at` is the cold-gap start, so genuine re-engagement dials
  land *after* it. Count = outbound dials strictly after `reactive_at`.
- **`partnership_rebook`** — `reactive_at` is the moment the setter *logs* the rebook
  (the triage form), so the rebook-driving dial lands a few minutes *before* it. For
  these leads only, the bracket **also** counts the single most-recent outbound dial in
  `(opt-in, reactive_at]` (migration 0088). Cold leads are excluded from this — their
  last pre-anchor dial is a stale primary-phase dial 2–3 days earlier.

Both the SQL (`sales_funnel_counts`) and the JS fallback (`leads-funnel.ts`
`scanDialWindows`) apply this. Note the bracket (outbound dials) can still be < Connected,
because **Connected counts a ≥90s call in EITHER direction** — an inbound ≥90s call has no
outbound dial behind it (a triage-form reach does not count as connected).

### Qualified — from Typeform, per cycle (2026-06-15)

Qualification comes from the **Typeform SFedWelr investment answer** ("how much are you
willing to invest", field `5138f17b…`): **≥ $2,000 = qualified**, "Under $2,000" =
unqualified, no answer = unknown. The tagger materializes it **per opt-in cycle** onto
`lead_cycles.qualified` (migration 0083) from *that cycle's* submission — so a lead that
re-opts-in with a different answer re-qualifies correctly (e.g. Ronald Riccardi: May-25
"Under $2,000" → false, Jun-10 "$2,000 and $5,000" → true).

This **replaced `close_leads.marketing_qualified`**, which went stale on re-opt-ins —
especially cross-email (Close wouldn't refresh the flag). `sales_funnel_counts` and the
roster's qualified column both read `lead_cycles.qualified` (migrations 0084 + the roster
read). The Close column is no longer used for funnel qualification.

**Direct box's first node = TOTAL qualified opt-ins** (every qualified lead in the window,
direct + setter), not qualified-who-booked — so Booked is a true subset (Jun 1–14: 89
qualified → 61 booked). The Setter box's qualified/unqualified split and the Reactivation
box's read the same `lead_cycles.qualified`.

## High Ticket vs Digital College

- **High Ticket (HT)** — the AI Partner program. The default funnel is HT-only.
- **Digital College (DC)** — the low-ticket offer (Base44 + Wix, sold Monthly/Yearly),
  often a downsell.

**Closer identity routes everything** (migration 0076):
`DC_CLOSER_NAMES = ("robby", "bradley", "josh", "adam")` → DC funnel; other closers
(e.g. Aman = HT closer) → HT. Routing is read from
the **main closer EOC form** (`airtable_full_closer_report`), not the dedicated DC form.

**Surfaced as Connects → Closed** (`getDcFunnel` / `DcFunnelSection`).
Booked/Showed are no longer displayed (the `dc_booked_at`/`dc_showed_at` columns stay):

- **DC connects** (a DC conversation) = `digital_college_at` is set — any DC engagement.
- **DC closed** = `dc_closed_at` is set (a real `dc_plans` plan was sold), **any origin**.
- **Downsells are merged in** (HT closer selling DC: `dc_close_origin = downsell_ht_meeting`
  or `downsell_confirmation`) — they count as a connect **and** a close, no longer split out.
- The tagger's per-stage detail still exists: `dc_showed_at` = a DC-closer form present;
  `dc_closed_at` origin distinguishes `dc_closer` vs the two downsell kinds. The funnel just
  reads `digital_college_at` + `dc_closed_at` and ignores the split.
- The tagger's `closed_at` / `close_type` are **HT-only**. **Robby's EOC forms are
  fully excluded from HT show/close** (not just his closes).
- `lead_cycles` DC columns (0076): `digital_college_at`, `dc_booked_at`, `dc_showed_at`,
  `dc_close_origin` (`dc_closed_at` pre-existed).

## Revival (separate campaign — not part of the main funnel)

The **DC Revival** re-engagement campaign. Leads carry `REVIVAL_CF`
(`cf_QivXkWBvr34UIDkUBKXNCQo6woarc62wEbIacWWbN7P`, "DC Revival Lead") — ~24k as of Jun 2026 and
growing (the SMS workflow auto-creates/stamps them). They have no Typeform cycle, so they drop out
of the cohort, the tagger, and every main funnel. The **`/outbound`** page (renamed from
`/funnel/revival` 2026-06-24) is the **only** surface that counts them. Signals are **materialized**
into `outbound_lead_facts` off the page load (no live raw-signal scan). Per-lead anchor = later of
(`date_created`, `2026-06-03 00:00 ET` — the blast start); a signal counts only if its timestamp ≥
anchor.

Outbound is now **multi-campaign** (a campaign switcher — Revival, Jacob, …). The SMS tool stamps
every campaign's leads with the Revival CF too, so the pools are made **mutually exclusive** at the
facts layer: a lead is counted under its most specific campaign only (`outbound_campaigns.sort_order`),
so Revival excludes the ~8.6k Jacob sub-pool. See `surfaces.md` § Outbound and
`schema/outbound_campaigns.md`.

A revival **close** = a closer form (old or new) carrying an explicit DC plan
(Base/Wix × Monthly/Yearly) — plan-presence is the signal, **not** the `call_outcome`
string (Robby over-marks "Digital College Closed"). Showed/booked read the closer/triage
forms directly and were always correct.

### Setter-call review rubric splits on call type

`setter_call_reviews` (the Deepgram→Sonnet review of setter calls) grades two kinds of call
differently, keyed by **`call_type`**:

- **`outbound`** — a normal setting call; the goal is to **book** a closer call. Graded on
  `booked` / `no_book_reason` ("why it didn't book").
- **`revival`** — a Digital College reactivation call; the rep **closes on the phone**, not
  books. Graded on `closed` / `no_close_reason` ("why it didn't close"). A soft hand-off to a
  future meeting is a *missed close*, not a win.

The inactive pair is null (a revival row has `booked = null`; an outbound row has `closed =
null`); a CHECK enforces exactly the right outcome per `call_type`. The reviewer picks the
rubric from its **is_revival** check — the lead's **`REVIVAL_CF`** ("DC Revival Lead") custom
field being non-empty, the same canonical revival marker the tagger and the `/outbound` funnel
use (`close_leads.custom_fields_raw->>REVIVAL_CF`). The first cut keyed off an opt-in-date proxy
(`latest_opt_in_date < 2026-05-24`) and **silently missed the bulk of revival leads** — the
SMS-created DC Revival leads often carry no opt-in date at all, so they fell through to the book
rubric; fixed 2026-06-30 to use the CF. Prompt `v2` carries the split
(`agents/setter_call_reviewer/prompt.py`); migration `0121` added the columns. Going-forward
calls are graded by `call_type` automatically. `scripts/rereview_revival_setter_calls.py` is an
idempotent re-grade tool — it finds reviews whose stored `call_type` disagrees with the detector
and flips them book↔close.

Don't confuse **Revival** (this campaign) with **Reactivation** (a unique lead that lost
its strategy-call spot — a `lead_cycles` flag, part of the main funnel).

## Cash Collected / ROAS

A Cash block on the Funnel page, separate from the DC funnel. Two rows, each split
HT / DC / total:

- **Upfront** = `amount_paid_today`.
- **Contract** = `contract_amount_to_send` (closers leave `total_contract_amount`
  empty — key off `contract_amount_to_send`).
- **ROAS** = cash ÷ **Closer-Funnel adspend** (`Closer Funnel`-token campaigns in
  `cortana_campaign_daily`, per-day fallback to `meta_ad_daily` account total before
  2026-05-26).
- DC is priced at a flat **$300 per plan unit** (`DC_PLAN_PRICE_USD`), same upfront and
  contract.

## Lead → ad attribution + the Campaign → Ad Set → Ad cascade (updated 2026-06-15)

Every unique lead carries its full ad hierarchy **natively from Close** — `close_leads`
holds `campaign_id`, `adset_id`, `ad_id` (+ `ad_name`, `utm_campaign`), **~99% populated**
on the cohort (all three present on 439/439 in the Jun 1–14 check). The three IDs form a
**clean tree** — each ad belongs to exactly one ad set, each ad set to one campaign — so the
funnel is sliceable at any level. `ad_id` joins `cortana_ad_daily.platform_entity_id` (the
Meta ad id) at 100%; `lead_cycles` also carries `ad_id`/`ad_name`/`campaign_id` (migration
0078) as a copy of the lead's single Close attribution.

### The cascade filter

The Funnel page's ad filter (`components/sales/ad-cascade-filter.tsx`) is **three dependent
dropdowns — Campaign → Ad Set → Ad**. Choosing a campaign narrows the ad-set list to that
campaign's ad sets; choosing an ad set narrows the ad list. The **deepest** selection scopes
the whole funnel (box counts + the rosters the stages link to). `sales_funnel_counts`
filters by `cl.campaign_id` / `cl.adset_id` / `lc.ad_id` (migration 0085 added
`p_campaign`/`p_adset` — close_leads is already joined in the `cyc` CTE, so no new columns).
`LeadRow` carries `campaignId`/`campaignName`/`adsetId`; `buildAdHierarchy` (funnel page)
builds the tree from the rows. Funnel stage links + the leads roster carry the cascade
through, so a drill keeps the selection.

| Level | Filter key | Name source | Spend / ROAS source |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Campaign | `campaign_id` | `utm_campaign` (+ `cortana_campaign_daily.entity_name`) | `cortana_campaign_daily.spent` |
| Ad Set | `adset_id` | `cortana_adset_daily.entity_name` (`getAdsetNameMap`) | `cortana_adset_daily.spent` |
| Ad | `ad_id` | `ad_name` (+ `cortana_ad_daily.entity_name`) | `cortana_ad_daily.spent` |

**Ad-set names + spend (migration 0089; ad-set grain native since 2026-06-30).** The
cascade's Ad Set level is fully named with spend/ROAS via `cortana_adset_daily`. Since the
**Meta Marketing API** swap (2026-06-30) this is sourced from `level=adset` — `adset_id` and
`adset_name` come **natively** from Meta, joining `close_leads.adset_id` directly. *(History:
2026-06-17 → 06-30 it rode Cortana's `groupBy=medium` feed — Cortana had no native ad-set
grouping, so it keyed each `utm_medium` row to the Meta ad-set id via `platformEntityId` and
ingestion kept only numeric ids to drop organic/placement noise. The native Meta feed makes
that hack unnecessary.)*

### Coverage / "unattributed"

The ~1% of cohort leads with no `ad_id` are **not all organic**: some carry the per-lead
`aaid_` token + the "Closer Funnel" marker (a real paid click) but Meta's ad-id URL macro
didn't populate, so `ad_id`/`adset_id`/`campaign_id` are blank in Close **and** in the
Typeform hidden fields — not recoverable from our data (the `aaid` is per-lead, doesn't map
to an ad). These drop out of the cascade. The per-ad-sum-vs-total gap on the funnel is
mostly the **cycles-vs-people** unit difference (the box counts opt-in *events*, the dropdown
counts *people*), not these unattributed leads.

- ⚠️ Don't confuse with the **~20%** figure in `logic.md` — that's a *different* join
  (Calendly bookings ↔ leads via `utm_term`), not lead→ad. Lead→ad is ~99%.
