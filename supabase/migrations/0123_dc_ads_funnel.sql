-- 0123_dc_ads_funnel.sql
-- Facts + RPCs for the DC ads funnel page (/sales-dashboard/dc-ads): the
-- Digital College paid-ads funnel — Meta instant-form opt-ins dialed by reps.
--
-- Deliberately a SIBLING of the outbound machinery (0093–0119), not a new
-- outbound_campaigns row: reusing outbound_lead_facts would leak these leads
-- into the Outbound page's "All" view (outbound_funnel/by_rep treat NULL
-- campaign key as every campaign). Same stage logic, separate table+functions.
--
-- Differences from outbound, on purpose (these are inbound ad opt-ins, not
-- cold outbound):
--   * membership   = close_leads.funnel_name='Digital College' AND campaign_id
--                    in meta_leadgen_campaigns (the Meta→Close bridge stamps
--                    both within seconds of the form submit)
--   * anchor       = close_leads.date_created (≈ the form-submit time)
--   * first_dial   = first OUTBOUND call after the opt-in — no "replied first"
--                    precondition (outbound requires a reply before a dial
--                    counts; an ad opt-in IS the hand-raise)
--   * speed-to-dial= first_dial - anchor (opt-in → dial), not reply → dial
--   * no "responded" funnel stage (kept as has_inbound for reference only)
--
-- Refresh: refresh_dc_ads_facts() is called by api/outbound_facts_refresh_cron.py
-- each tick (after Close/Airtable syncs land) and by meta_leads_sync after a
-- lead backfill.

comment on table dc_ads_lead_facts is
  'Per-lead funnel facts for the DC ads funnel page — Digital College Meta lead-form opt-ins mirrored into Close. Sibling of outbound_lead_facts (same stage semantics, ad-opt-in anchor). Rebuilt by refresh_dc_ads_facts(). See docs/schema/dc_ads_lead_facts.md.';
comment on column dc_ads_lead_facts.anchor is
  'close_leads.date_created ≈ the Meta form-submit time (the opt-in).';
comment on column dc_ads_lead_facts.first_dial is
  'First outbound close_calls dial at/after the opt-in (no reply precondition — differs from outbound).';
comment on column dc_ads_lead_facts.optin_bucket is
  '2-hour ET bucket (0-11) of the opt-in time; dial_bucket/conn_bucket likewise for first dial / first ≥90s connect.';
