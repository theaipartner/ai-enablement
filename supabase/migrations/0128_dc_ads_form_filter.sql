-- 0128_dc_ads_form_filter.sql
-- The DC ads page grows a FORMS dropdown beside the campaign → ad set → ad
-- cascade (Meta runs more than one instant form — "7/8 - Basic Form",
-- "7/13 - Basic Form", …). The Meta→Close bridge stamps campaign/adset/ad ids
-- on close_leads but NOT the form id, so the refresh derives it: match the
-- lead's contact phone (last 10 digits) to meta_form_leads.phone_number — the
-- identity key for these leads (the forms collect no email) — and take the
-- NEWEST submission's form, mirroring the "a returning phone re-anchors at
-- its newest opt-in" rule. Live coverage check 2026-07-15: 232/232 pool leads
-- phone-match a Meta submission.
--
-- dc_ads_funnel / dc_ads_funnel_by_rep / dc_ads_daily gain p_form_id (an AND
-- facet — it composes with the cascade instead of the deepest-wins rule,
-- since a form spans many ads). Signature change → drop + recreate, same as
-- 0126: CREATE OR REPLACE would overload and make existing PostgREST calls
-- ambiguous; recreating with defaults keeps the deployed page working across
-- the swap.
